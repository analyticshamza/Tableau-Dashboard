#Superstore Sales Dashboard 
I created this interactive Tableau dashboard using the Superstore dataset to analyze sales, profits, orders, and customer insights for 2012.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Interactive filters â€“ switch by category, sub-category, state, and year.

Click-to-filter charts â€“ explore sales by segment, region, and sub-category dynamically.

Hover tooltips â€“ detailed insights on sales & profit trends.

KPI Cards & Trend Lines â€“ quick view of orders, sales, profits, and quantities.

Customer & Shipping Analysis â€“ top 10 customers and ship mode performance.

This dashboard gives a comprehensive view of business performance, helping stakeholders track growth, identify profitable areas, and spot opportunities.
